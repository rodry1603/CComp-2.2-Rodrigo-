Huh, I beat the back out the bitch
I walk in barefoot like Rick
This not the time to confess
Sleep with two phones on my chest
Yesterday, I was just broke, today, I look sexy and blessed
Every time I come back home, baby girl kiss on my neck
These girls keep calling me handsome
Flew out to England and I'm with Lil Mexico
Cropping that bitch out my pic' because she too thick
She must be a messy hoe (yeah, yeah)
Put that on my kids
I'm tired of the boogers, these big protein boogers
Get that weak shit out of my face
I gotta be honest, I cannot be happy
Unless my whole team get a taste
NDA rent, cancel your ass yesterday
'Cause a nigga gon' die 'bout respect, huh
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Hol' up, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Ayy, smoke in the basket, uh
I'm in a casket 'cause I get ratchet, uh
King of the fashion, you can't get active
Beat your ass up for it, I caught you lackin'
Eat your ass up for it, I caught you brackin'
Kick your ass up for it, I'm with the drama
Front of your mama, front of your daddy, your sister, your aunt
200K taxes, please do not sue me
I can't afford to buy Paul June a blunt, uh
Bitch, hand me the rock
Rock band on me and I look attractive
Holding up five fingers, my numbers are brackin'
Barbarian shit, Barbarian tactic
My name is Booman, my name is not Jeff
I told you that I am a Barbarian
I told you that I am a Barbarian
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
Hol' up, I'm sexy and blessed
Uh, I'm sexy and blessed
